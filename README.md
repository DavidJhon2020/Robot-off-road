# Robot-off-road
Cooperate with graduate students to participate in the off-road track of the school robot school competition, the main purpose is to realize the functions of the trolley such as tracking, obstacle avoidance, and off-road. It is mainly responsible for the initialization of the encoder Implementation of PID code with trace sections.
## Project purpose
1.机器人自主识别赛道引导线、障碍物、中心分隔带、边框等，在其赛道内，围绕中心分隔带逆时针越野  
3.启动功能：挥手启动机器人出发  
4.停车功能：到达终点后自主停机
